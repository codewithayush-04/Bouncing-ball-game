🎮 Bouncing Ball Game

A simple Bouncing Ball Game created using Emergent AI. This project demonstrates basic game physics, animation, and event handling while showcasing how AI-assisted development can speed up learning and prototyping.



📌 Project Overview

The Bouncing Ball Game is a browser-based game where a ball moves continuously and bounces off the edges of the screen. The game focuses on understanding motion, collision detection, and smooth animations.

This project was built with the help of Emergent, an AI-powered development platform that assists in generating code, logic, and structure efficiently.



🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	HTML5 – Structure of the game
	•	CSS3 – Styling and layout
	•	JavaScript – Game logic, animation, and physics
	•	Emergent AI – AI-assisted code generation and development support



🎯 Features of the Game
	•	Smooth ball movement using animation loops
	•	Collision detection with walls
	•	Realistic bouncing behavior
	•	Responsive canvas that adapts to screen size
	•	Clean and beginner-friendly code structure



🚀 What I Learned from This Project

1. Core Game Development Concepts
	•	Understanding coordinates and movement on a 2D plane
	•	Using loops (like requestAnimationFrame) for smooth animation
	•	Implementing collision detection with boundaries
	•	Applying basic physics concepts such as velocity and direction

2. JavaScript Skills
	•	DOM manipulation and canvas handling
	•	Working with functions and variables efficiently
	•	Debugging and improving logic flow

3. Problem-Solving & Logic Building
	•	Breaking down a game into small logical components
	•	Identifying and fixing movement and collision bugs
	•	Improving performance and smoothness
